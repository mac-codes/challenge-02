## Challenge 2

for this challenge I was prompted to make a portfolio page! it was really fun writing this code from scratch. I had an example website to work off of and I think I matched it relatively well with the CSS knowledge I have. We were asked to have a nav bar, an about me section, a my work section and a contact me section.The nav bar will link you to different areas on my website. in the about me section I wrote two paragraphs explaining my experience and passions. for the my work section I made 6 cards. the first card has a picture that links to  the first project we did for school. the other cards are coming soon! lastly I only put my email on the contact me area because that's my main form of communication.
